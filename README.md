# Deep Imbalanced Regression to Estimate Vascular Age from PPG Data: a Novel Digital Biomarker for Cardiovascular Health
## Introduction
In this repo, we provide our PyTorch implementation of the Dist loss <https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14953>, which is a simple yet effective loss function based on data distribution priors, designed for deep imbalanced regression tasks (e.g., vascular age estimation from PPG data).  
## Usage
Here, we provide an example to use the Dist loss in a regression task in the <div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">. example.ipynb </div>
